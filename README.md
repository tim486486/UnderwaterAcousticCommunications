These are the files for my Master's Thesis project. It consists of:

* Three Arduino projects, one that was running on the shore and one for each of the underwater nodes.
* The MATLAB functions that I used to process, parse and visualize the data.
* A simple C project for recording the data from the Master Arduino node onto the laptop. This wasn't used in the end because I sprung for the bigger Arduino with an SD card.

The final results and a more detailed explanation of all of the functionality is available in the included pdf.
